# KNN
This is a program I wrote to implement a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. This was only created because I wanted a quick walkthrough of the logic before I implemented it in C++. I am trying to learn C++ and am writing a KNN algorithm in C++ as a learning project, this will be my guide. NOTE, I did not use any resources to write the program, only the algorithm seen in Stanfords Statistical Learning online book.
